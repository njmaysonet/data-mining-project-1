### Project 1 Apriori Algorithm ###
# Members: David Acosta, Anthony Athens, Nestor Maysonet #

Use `myapriori.py` in `./apriori` to run the algorithm.

You need to set **minsup** and **minconf** such as `myapriori.py mydata.txt 100 0.5`
along with a song data file separated with `::` delimiters.

**Please put the data file in the `apriori` folder.**

Also included for reference is the project .pdf file and the charts generated
in the Jupyter notebooks.

**Do not** run the Apriori in the notebooks, they were used for exploration and
generating visuals.
